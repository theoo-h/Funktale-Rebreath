**Funktale' Rebreath** was a Friday Night Funkin' mod bringing "Undertale Last Breath" history to the game, and rebirth of the cancelled mod "(Funktale: Last Hope)[https://x.com/PapuTeamXD/status/1768082201449550086]"

This mod was cancelled because of the lack of motivation from me, theo.
Not gonna lie, i was making almosth the entire mod, i code the entire mod,
i did a lot of songs, like:
    - Phase 1 Song
    - Phase 3 Song (remake)

    - The final song, Sunder (a 3 person collab)
    - Joke songs (Komi sans, Destroyer (sans me destroso), Sanness)
i also charted most of the songs. (phase 1, phase 2 wip, phase 3 wip)

I did a lot for this mod, i did learn a lot, i had joy while developing this,
as i said, i did learn a bunch of stuff while developng this, coding, music,
and other stuff, but, its time to let go.

Most of the code is trash honestly, especially the Attack Editor.

I will someday upload wip stuff that its not on the build.
